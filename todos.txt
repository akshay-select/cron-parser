How to approach this problem? 
* Understand cron expression in detail! 
* Come up with a UML diagram (with pros and cons)
* Implement classes and methods
* Handle exceptions, errors, logging
* Learn testing in python + implement test classes
* Check if the solution is extensible + try add new features and test... 
* Refine solution
* Update Readme and push code! 


Todos
 [*] Update parser util and handle edge cases
 [*] Write unit tests for the utils and verify for working
 [*] Integrate the parsers with Feilds and verify for working! 
 [*] Write unit tests for Feild, Cron expression?
 [ ] Custom exceptions and exception handling + logging
 [ ] Is this extensible? why or why not?
 [ ] Compare with other codebases! 
 [ ] Through code review + fix issues, namings exception
 [ ] Push code to github!
